 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE AGENT DOES TODAY
 *
 * Today every inbound reply is answered from scratch — the agent reads the
 * thread and writes something. That is stateless, and a stateless agent cannot
 * run a script: it has no way of knowing that it already asked about licensing
 * and is waiting for the answer. So the same question gets asked again, or a
 * different one gets asked at random, and the lead is never actually
 * qualified.
 *
 * This module is the missing memory, and it is deliberately the smallest
 * possible one: a step counter and a list of answers. Everything else —
 * writing the words, deciding whether it is safe to send them — lives
 * elsewhere.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PURE, AND IT NEVER DECIDES TO SEND
 *
 * `advance` takes the config, the stored state and what the lead just said,
 * and returns what SHOULD happen. Persisting it and acting on it belong to
 * thread-state.ts and runtime.ts. That split is what lets the whole script be
 * tested — including the awkward paths, like a lead who replies twice before
 * we answer once — without a database or a model.

 * introduction contacts — exactly what the composer's Introduce button inserts
 * and copies in, produced by the same two functions, so the two cannot drift.

 * the same substitution, so it may use `{{lead.first_name}}` and the rest.
