/*
 * The gate every automatic send passes through.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
 *
 * Everywhere else in this app an email leaves because a person clicked send.
 * Live mode removes the person. Plan §12 is the price of that: one gate, and
 * anything that fails it HOLDS and FLAGS rather than sending. The requirements
 * record calls the same thing out as open question Q8 — hostile replies,
 * unsubscribes and complaints were never discussed on the call, and they are
 * the reputational exposure that auto-send creates.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE SHAPE: FACTS IN, VERDICT OUT
 *
 * `evaluate` is pure. Everything it needs has already been looked up by
 * safety-facts.ts, so the decision can be tested exhaustively — including the
 * combinations nobody wants to reproduce against a live inbox — and so that
 * the reason a reply was held is a value, not a log line.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ORDER OF THE CHECKS IS NOT ARBITRARY
 *
 * The first failure is the reason reported, so the checks run cheapest-and-
 * most-absolute first:
 *
 *   1. live_disabled          the server gate. Nothing can send, full stop.
 *   2. not_live_mode          this agent is paused or in shadow.
 *   3. do_not_contact         this person must never be emailed again.
 *   4. unsubscribe_requested  they asked us to stop, in this thread.
 *   5. hostile_reply          the classifier already judged this thread.
 *   6. needs_human_review     something in the reply is above the agent's pay grade.
 *   7. send_cap_reached       this thread has had enough automated replies.
 *   8. rate_limited           the workspace is sending too fast.
 *   9. outside_send_window    the schedule says draft now, send later.
 *
 * Nine is last on purpose. It is the only failure that is expected, temporary
 * and self-resolving: the release job retries it when the window opens. The
 * eight above it are reasons a person should look, and one of them turning into
 * "held until 6pm" would bury it.
