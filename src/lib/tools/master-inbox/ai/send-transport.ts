/*
 * The last inch: handing a composed reply to EmailBison or Instantly.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ONE SEND PATH, THE COMPOSER'S
 *
 * There is no provider call in this file. `dispatch` builds the request a
 * person's composer would have built for the same draft and hands it to
 * `sendOutboundReply` (lib .../inbox/send-reply.ts) — the reply route's own
 * send core, lifted out so it can be called without a session. Provider
 * resolution, the EmailBison /reply-or-/new choice, Instantly's forward
 * detection, the outbound `messages` row, the thread update, the feedback
 * verdict, the drafts marked sent, the composer auto-save cleanup: all of it
 * is the same code a person's send runs, with `actor: { kind: "agent" }`.
 *
 * A second path here would be the way the bookkeeping drifts: an agent send
 * the inbox list, the drafts view or the learning loop sees differently from
 * a person's. So there is none, and the plan (§10) — "extracted to a shared
 * function, with CC added" — is what this file is.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THE COMPOSER DOES TO A DRAFT BEFORE IT SENDS, REPRODUCED HERE
 *
 * The composer does NOT send what the draft holds. Read its `onSend`:
 *
 *   · The body it sends is HTML, always (`content_type: "html"`). An agent
 *     draft — `reply_drafts.generated_body` — is PLAIN TEXT with real
 *     newlines, and so is the introduction macro. The composer converts on
 *     the way in with `plainTextToHtml` (single newline → <br>, blank line →
 *     paragraph). Send the text as HTML without that step and every paragraph
 *     break is gone: the introduction arrives as one run-on block, "Best,"
 *     glued to the sentence before it. `agentBodyHtml` below is that
 *     conversion, done once, and it leaves a body that is already HTML alone
 *     so nothing is escaped twice.
 *
 *   · The subject is the source message's, normalised to exactly one "Re: "
 *     prefix (thread-view.tsx). `agentSubject` is that rule. `subject_changed`
 *     is false — reply mode locks the field — so EmailBison keeps threading
 *     through /replies/{id}/reply.
 *
 *   · The signature is appended only when the operator ticked "add signature",
 *     and that box defaults to OFF (`composerDraft?.add_signature ?? false`).
 *     A person's default send carries no signature, so neither does the
 *     agent's. Deliberate, and stated so nobody wonders.
 *
 *   · `reply_all` is "0" and `inject_previous_email_body` is "1" — the route's
 *     defaults, left as they are.
 *
 *   · The composer's CC field is pre-filled with the workspace's always-CC
 *     address. That is a composer concern, not a route one (the route sends
 *     `cc` verbatim). The agent's CC is the handover plan's list — the
 *     client's introduction contacts and the agent's extras — and nothing on
 *     an ordinary reply. Plan §4.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE GATE IS CHECKED HERE TOO
 *
 * The safety gate (ai/safety.ts, via attemptLiveSend) checks the env gate
 * first and holds with `live_disabled`. This function checks it AGAIN before
 * anything else, so that a caller which forgot the gate — or a future one
 * written in a hurry — still cannot send. With the variable unset, `dispatch`
 * returns `gated` having touched nothing: no database read, no provider
 * client, no request.
