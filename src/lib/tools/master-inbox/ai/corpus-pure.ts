/*
 * Turning our sent mail into something an agent can learn from.
 *
 * Pure on purpose — every judgement about what belongs in the corpus and what
 * it is worth is decided here, with no database in sight, so each rule can be
 * tested against a real example rather than argued about.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THE DATA LOOKS LIKE, AND WHY THESE RULES EXIST
 *
 * Measured on the live workspace: 23,888 replies we sent, 12,944 inbound,
 * 10,367 threads. Of the 600 most recent AI drafts, 517 were never sent and 82
 * of the 83 that were followed by a real reply had been rewritten. The agent
 * had no idea how we actually answer people — this is the fix for that.
 *
 * Three findings shaped the filters:
 *
 *   1. Replies are stored HTML-encoded. "you&#039;re" and "you're" are the
 *      same sentence; comparing them raw makes every send look like an edit.
 *   2. The introduction macro accounts for a large share of what we send and
 *      is pure template. Left in, it floods retrieval and teaches the agent to
 *      improvise introductions — which is exactly the failure observed: it
 *      invented a contact where the real reply named two by title.
 *   3. Most threads end in "Not Interested" or an unsubscribe. Those are worth
 *      learning to close politely, but they must not crowd out the handful of
 *      replies that actually advanced a deal.
