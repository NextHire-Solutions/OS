 * The live path: what happens between "the reply is written" and "the reply

 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ONE FUNCTION, ONE DECISION
 *
 * Every automatic send in this feature goes through `attemptLiveSend`. Not
 * because it is tidy, but because a second path is how a safety gate gets
 * bypassed: the first time someone needs to send "just the handover" from
 * somewhere else, the checks are not there. The release job (ai/release.ts)
 * calls this same function for a held reply rather than re-implementing the
 * shortened version of it that it could get away with.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A REFUSAL IS A RECORD, NOT A LOG LINE
 *
 * Plan §12: "Anything that fails holds and flags instead of sending." So a
 * refusal writes `hold_reason`, `held_draft_id` and `held_at` onto the thread
 * state, which is what the screen reads to show a person that a live agent
 * wanted to send and was not allowed, and what the release job reads to try
 * again when the reason was temporary.

 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THROUGH THE GUARDED PATH, NOT AROUND IT
 *
 * Applying the Introduction label is not bookkeeping. It notifies the client
 * over n8n, posts to Slack, opens a pipeline entry in that client's portal and
 * pushes it to Follow Up Boss. For a long time this function did only the
 * checks and refused the write, because the only place that applied the label
 * with all of that intact was the labels route, and the route needs a session.
 *
 * The route's core is now `applyLabelToThread` (lib .../inbox/apply-label.ts),
 * and this calls it with `actor: { kind: "agent" }`. Same guard, same wipe,
 * same notes snapshot, same announcements — with no request scope, so the
 * side effects run inline, best-effort, and never throw back here.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE GUARD THE ROUTE INSISTS ON
 *
 * A thread that already carries the Introduction label must NOT be announced
 * again: the route's `alreadyCarriedThisLabel` check exists because one
 * introduction was producing two Slack posts. It is checked here first — so a
 * human's earlier label is not rewritten — and checked again inside
 * `applyLabelToThread`, which is the check that decides whether to announce.
 * "Already carries it" and "there is no such label" are both silent, correct
 * outcomes for the label; only a failed write is a problem, and it is recorded
 * rather than thrown.
