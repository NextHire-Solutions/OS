/*
 * The four decisions this upgrade makes, tested where they are made.
 *
 * Every one of these is a decision that, if wrong, is wrong quietly:
 *
 *   · WHICH AGENT runs on a thread — get it wrong and one client's agent
 *     answers another client's lead.
 *   · WHERE A CONVERSATION HAS GOT TO — get it wrong and the same question is
 *     asked twice, or the last answer is never counted.
 *   · WHETHER IT IS OUT OF HOURS — get it wrong and the after-hours cover the
 *     client is buying sends during their working day instead.
 *   · WHETHER IT IS SAFE TO SEND — get it wrong and a hostile lead gets an
 *     automated reply.
 *   · WHAT THE HANDOVER SAYS AND WHO IT COPIES — get it wrong and a lead is
 *     introduced to the wrong people, or to nobody, in the client's name.
 *
 * None of them can be checked by looking at a screen, which is why they are all
 * pure functions and why the tests are here rather than in a browser.
