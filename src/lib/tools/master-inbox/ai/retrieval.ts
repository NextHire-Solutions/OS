/*
 * What the agent gets to read before it writes.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
 *
 * The old agent wrote from a bare prompt and its record says so: of 600 drafts,
 * 517 were never sent, and of the 83 that were, 82 were rewritten by hand. Not
 * one went out as written. It was not a bad model — it simply had no idea how
 * this company answers people, so it invented a house style every time.
 *
 * Three things are put in front of it here, in order of how specific they are:
 *
 *   1. the thread itself      — already handled in reply.ts, which renders the
 *                               full conversation; nothing to add
 *   2. the nearest precedents — the real replies we sent to the most similar
 *                               inbound messages we have ever received
 *   3. the standing rules     — the distilled style guide and objection
 *                               playbook, which say what is true EVERY time
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EVERYTHING HERE FAILS SOFT, ON PURPOSE
 *
 * This code sits on the path of a button a person is waiting on. An empty
 * corpus, an un-run migration, a missing OpenAI key or a slow embedding must
 * all degrade to "no extra context" — which is exactly today's behaviour — and
 * never to an error. `gatherGuidance` therefore catches everything and reports
 * what it managed in `source`, so the screen can say why a draft was thin
 * rather than leaving it to be guessed at.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE POOL IS HELD IN MEMORY
 *
 * Cosine is computed in process — there is no pgvector (see the migration for
 * why). That means every candidate's vector has to be here. The corpus is
 * ~1,300 examples at 1,536 dimensions, about 15 MB of JavaScript numbers, and
 * it only changes when somebody presses Rebuild. Fetching 15 MB of JSON per
 * draft would make the button slower than the model; loading it once per
 * process and refreshing every ten minutes costs one read an hour in practice.
 *
 * `staleMs` is set so the refresh never blocks a draft: past the TTL the last
 * pool is served immediately and the new one loads behind it.
