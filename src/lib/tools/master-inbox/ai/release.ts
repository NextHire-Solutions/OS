/*
 * The release job: replies a live agent wrote inside business hours and was
 * not allowed to send yet.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY A JOB AND NOT A TIMER
 *
 * Plan §5: an off-hours agent drafts during the day and "a background job
 * releases the held replies when the window opens". The obvious
 * implementation — sleep until 6pm — does not survive a deploy, and this app
 * redeploys several times a day. So the state lives in the database
 * (`agent_thread_state.hold_reason` / `held_draft_id` / `held_at`) and this
 * function is a sweep: it asks what is waiting, and sends whatever is now
 * allowed. A missed run delays a reply; it never loses one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IT RE-RUNS THE WHOLE GATE, NOT JUST THE SCHEDULE
 *
 * The temptation is to check "is the window open now?" and send. But a held
 * reply can be hours old, and in those hours the lead may have unsubscribed,
 * the thread may have been labelled Hostile, or a person may have already
 * replied by hand. So a release is an ordinary send attempt through
 * `attemptLiveSend`, with every check applied again from scratch. Age is a
 * reason to be more careful, not less.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HOW IT IS DRIVEN
 *
 * POST /api/tools/master-inbox/reply-agents/release, called by whatever the
 * workspace already uses to drive recurring work — the browser-driven outbox
 * sweep, or the in-process scheduler in lib/tools/master-inbox/sync/scheduler.ts
 * (one line in its JOBS map). It is claim-free and idempotent: two overlapping
 * runs on the same held reply both go through the gate, and the second finds
 * the hold already cleared.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A RELEASED HANDOVER CARRIES ITS CC
 *
 * The `reply_drafts` row holds only the body; the CC list — the client's
 * introduction contacts — is not stored anywhere. So a released handover
 * resolves it exactly as the runtime did when it wrote the draft: the same
 * `assembleRunInput` read and the same `planHandover` call. An introduction
 * that copies nobody is not an introduction, so if the client has lost its
 * details in the meantime the plan says stop, and so does this.
