/*
 * The agent's configuration, and which agent runs on a thread.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS A PURE MODULE
 *
 * Nothing here touches the database or the network. Five jsonb columns arrive
 * as `unknown` from Supabase and leave as typed values with safe defaults, and
 * one function decides which agent owns a conversation. Both are decisions we
 * want to be able to test without a database and to lift into the standalone
 * Master Inbox app unchanged — the upgrade plan puts the config UI there, and
 * this file is the part that must not be rewritten when it moves.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * EVERY PARSER IS TOTAL, AND EVERY DEFAULT IS THE SAFE ONE
 *
 * These columns are edited by people through a UI and read on the path of an
 * inbound webhook. A malformed `schedule` must not throw inside a webhook
 * handler — it must degrade to a configuration that cannot do any harm. So:
 *
 *   run_mode        anything unrecognised → "pause"   (do nothing)
 *   qualification   anything unrecognised → disabled  (no multi-turn script)
 *   handover        anything unrecognised → no extra CC, no Introduction label
 *                   (the client's own contacts are still copied in — they come
 *                   from the client record, not from this column)
 *   schedule        anything unrecognised → off-hours-only, not always-on
 *
 * Note the direction of each fallback: when we cannot understand the config,
 * the agent does LESS, never more. The one that looks backwards is `schedule`
 * — "always" is the permissive value, so an unreadable schedule falls back to
 * the restrictive one.
