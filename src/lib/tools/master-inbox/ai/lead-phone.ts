/*
 * The lead's own phone number, taken from the conversation.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE CONVERSATION BEATS THE RECORD
 *
 * The enrichment payload's number was scraped from a listing and can be a
 * years-old office line. When a lead writes back, their signature carries the
 * number they actually answer — and if they typed one into the body, that is
 * the number they are asking to be called on. The record is the fallback, not
 * the source.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE TRAP: AN INBOUND MESSAGE CONTAINS OUR OWN WORDS
 *
 * Email clients quote the message being replied to, so an inbound body very
 * often ends with our previous email — signature and all. Measured on real
 * threads, one inbound message contained "Can you confirm that (602) 625-4675
 * is the best number to reach you", which is OUR agent's own sentence about
 * someone else's number, sitting inside the lead's reply.
 *
 * So two defences, both necessary:
 *   1. quoted blocks are stripped before scanning
 *   2. any number that also appears in an OUTBOUND turn is discarded outright
 *
 * Getting this wrong does not throw. It puts a stranger's phone number in an
 * email to a client's prospect.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * LABELS DECIDE WHICH NUMBER, WHEN THERE ARE SEVERAL
 *
 * A realtor's signature routinely carries three: "Cell 770 654-0956 Office 770
 * 271-5555", "m. 919-449-8020 o. 954-799-5182", "Main: 804-270-9440 Direct:
 * 804-967-2778". The one to ring is the mobile, so a labelled mobile wins, a
 * labelled office loses to it, and an unlabelled number sits between them.

/*
 * North-American shapes, which is all this estate sends to.
 *
 * SEPARATORS ARE SPACE, DOT AND HYPHEN — deliberately not \s, which matches a
 * NEWLINE. With \s this fused a licence number and a street number on adjacent
 * lines ("*CalBRE # *01316711" / "6641 West Broad St") into "1316711 6641" and
 * offered it to a lead as their phone number.
 *
 * The lookarounds stop a ten-digit run being cut out of a longer one, which is
 * how an order number or a tracking code becomes a phone call.
