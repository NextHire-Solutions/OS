/*
 * What the reply agent does when a lead replies.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THIS IS THE FILE THE PLAN'S §3 DIAGRAM DESCRIBES
 *
 *   lead reply arrives
 *     → pick the active agent for this client        agent-config.ts
 *     → branch on its mode:  pause → stop
 *                            shadow → draft, never send
 *                            live → continue
 *     → work the qualification script                qualification.ts
 *     → draft in the house voice                     agent.ts + retrieval.ts
 *       … or, when qualified, the introduction       qualification.ts (planHandover)
 *     → safety gate, then send                       live.ts + safety.ts
 *     → hand over by CC when qualified               live.ts
 *
 * Every step is a separate module and this one only sequences them, which is
 * deliberate: the plan puts the finished feature in the standalone MasterInbox
 * app, and a port that has to re-derive the sequencing is a port that changes
 * behaviour. Nothing here imports a route, a React component or a workspace
 * helper — only the engine and Supabase.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IT RETURNS AN OUTCOME AND IT NEVER THROWS
 *
 * The call sites are webhook handlers (EmailBison, Instantly), which must ack
 * the provider whatever happened in here. Every failure is a value.

 *
 * That is exactly what the two sync workers do — sync/emailbison.ts and
 * sync/instantly.ts call this in place of their old "pick the first active
 * agent and draft" block — so the engine runs on every inbound reply.
 *
 * `options.ourName`: the EmailBison webhook carries the sender mailbox's
 * display name, and the old block passed it through to the prompt ("Your name
 * (the sender): …"). The thread row does not store it, so the worker hands it
 * in here rather than lose it. Optional; absent, the prompt says "You".
