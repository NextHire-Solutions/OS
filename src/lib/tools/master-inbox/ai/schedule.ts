/*
 * When a live agent is allowed to send.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS
 *
 * Plan §5: an agent sends either 24/7, or only OUTSIDE business hours — the
 * after-hours and weekend cover that is the whole reason the client asked for
 * this. Inside business hours an off-hours agent still writes the reply; it
 * just holds it, and the release job (ai/release.ts) sends it when the window
 * opens.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHOSE CLOCK
 *
 * The requirements record leaves this open (Q4: reply managers are outside the
 * US, leads are in it), so the timezone is per-agent configuration and this
 * module never reads the server's clock zone. Railway containers run UTC; a
 * "9 to 5" evaluated in UTC would send during New York's afternoon, which is
 * exactly the failure this feature exists to avoid.
 *
 * `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with an explicit `timeZone` is the whole mechanism.
 * It handles DST for free, which a stored UTC offset would not: the window
 * must move with the clocks, not with the number we wrote down in March.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PURE, AND TESTED THAT WAY
 *
 * Every function takes `now` as an argument. No `Date.now()` anywhere, so the
 * tests can stand at 4:59pm on a Friday in New York and ask what happens.
