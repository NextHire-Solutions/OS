/*
 * What we did to the draft — measured, not asked for.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS ON THE SERVER AND NOT IN THE COMPOSER
 *
 * The obvious place to notice an edit is the textarea: the draft arrives, the
 * person changes it, the component knows both strings. But the composer only
 * knows what it was HANDED. It does not see a draft the sync worker wrote
 * overnight, it does not see a reply sent from a second tab, and a person who
 * pastes over the whole box leaves it with no memory of what was replaced.
 *
 * The send route sees all of it. `reply_drafts.generated_body` is what the
 * agent wrote and `payload.body` is what actually went out, and they meet in
 * one function on the way to the provider. So the measurement is taken there,
 * once, for every send — however the draft got there and whoever sent it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE NUMBER THIS PRODUCES
 *
 * as_written / light_edit / rewritten, against a baseline that is not flattering
 * and is not meant to be: of the last 600 drafts the old agent wrote, 517 were
 * never sent at all, and of the 83 that were followed by a real reply, 82 had
 * been rewritten. Zero went out as written. Any honest measure of this work is
 * whether that first number moves.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * NOTHING HERE MAY BREAK A SEND
 *
 * Every function is best-effort and catches its own failures. A person pressing
 * Send is sending an email to a real estate agent; our bookkeeping about how
 * well a model wrote it is not a reason to fail that.
