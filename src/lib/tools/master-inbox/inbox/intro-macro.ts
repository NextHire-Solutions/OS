/*
 * The introduction macro — one wording, rendered two ways.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
 *
 * The same paragraph is produced in two places and they must never drift:
 *
 *   1. Onboarding a client writes an "Intro Macro - <client>" row into
 *      `reply_templates`, so the wording is in the Templates picker and in
 *      the standalone Master Inbox as well.
 *   2. The Introduce button in the composer renders it on demand, from the
 *      client's CURRENT details, so correcting a role or a brokerage in
 *      Clients → Edit changes what the next introduction says.
 *
 * Before this module the wording lived inline in the clients API route and
 * (2) did not exist. Both now call `renderIntroMacroTemplate`.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO KINDS OF VALUE
 *
 * The client's values (who is being introduced) are known when a template is
 * written, so they are substituted HERE, into literal text.
 *
 * The lead's values (who is being introduced TO) are only known when a
 * particular conversation is open, so they stay as `{{lead.*}}` placeholders
 * and are resolved by `substituteVariables` at insert time — the same
 * substitution the Templates picker has always used, so a macro inserted by
 * the button and one inserted from the picker read identically.

 * that has been deleted matches nothing. The macro offers four such lines, so
