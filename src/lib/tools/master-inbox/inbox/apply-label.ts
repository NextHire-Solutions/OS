/*
 * Applying one label to one thread — the core of the labels route, lifted out
 * so that a caller WITHOUT a request can use it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The labels route (threads/[threadId]/labels/route.ts) was the only place a
 * label could be applied with all of its consequences intact, and it needs a
 * signed-in session. The reply agent's live handover has none: after it sends
 * an introduction it must label the thread Introduction, and for a long time
 * it refused to, because the alternative was a second, unreviewed copy of the
 * route's logic. This function IS the route's logic. The route now calls it
 * with `actor: { kind: "user" }` and the agent with `actor: { kind: "agent" }`,
 * and both get exactly the same behaviour.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT APPLYING A LABEL DOES (all of it preserved here, verbatim in effect)
 *
 *   · resolves the label's name; "introduction" (case-insensitive) is special
 *   · checks whether the thread ALREADY carries this label — the mandatory
 *     guard: applying Introduction announces it to the client (n8n, Slack, the
 *     portal pipeline, Follow Up Boss) and must never announce twice
 *   · if Introduction, snapshots pipeline notes BEFORE the wipe (the zero-label
 *     window lets the 0033 trigger cascade-delete the entry and its notes)
 *   · single-label semantics: deletes every other label, then upserts this one
 *   · Hostile → do-not-contact on the source platform
 *   · Introduction AND not already carried → the announcement side effects,
 *     through the durable outbox; then the notes snapshot is restored
 *   · Interested / Not Interested / away-from-Interested → the EmailBison
 *     interested-flag round trip
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `defer`: INSIDE A REQUEST OR NOT
 *
 * The route runs the side effects with Next's `after()`, which is request
 * scoped. Pass it as `defer` from a route handler. Leave it out from anywhere
 * else (the agent's send path, a job) and the same side effects run here,
 * in the same order, awaited one by one and each wrapped so that a failing
 * webhook can never throw back into the caller — the label is already written
 * by then, and for the agent the introduction has already been sent.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `supabase`: WHOSE CLIENT
 *
 * The caller supplies the client so the route keeps writing through the same
 * session-scoped client it always did, and the agent writes through the admin
 * client it always uses. This function does not choose; it must not widen a
 * user's access, and it must not narrow the agent's.

     * in that window loses them — and silently, which is the real problem. The
     * introduction is already in the database and already visible in the

     * never posted, Follow Up Boss never received the lead. Nobody finds out
     * until someone asks why a lead was never followed up.
     *
     * `enqueueIntroduction` records the intent for all three FIRST, then runs
     * exactly the same three calls, unchanged. The normal path is identical in
     * both timing and effect; what is added is that a lost attempt survives as
     * a row the sweeper retries.
     *
     * Two properties make this safe to prefer over the tool's version:
     *
     *   ENQUEUEING CANNOT BREAK LABELLING. If the outbox table is missing or
     *   the insert fails, it logs and runs the side effects anyway — the
     *   fallback IS the tool's behaviour.
     *
     *   RETRIES CANNOT DOUBLE-SEND ANYTHING HARMFUL. One row per kind per
     *   thread, enforced by a unique index; the FUB push is already idempotent
     *   on `fub_pushed_at`. A repeated Slack or n8n notice is noise, not
     *   damage.
     *
     * Registered in scripts/apply-port-fixes.mjs so a re-sync from the tool
     * cannot quietly revert it.
