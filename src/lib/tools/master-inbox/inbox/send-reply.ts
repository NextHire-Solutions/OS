/*
 * Sending one reply on one thread — the core of the reply route, lifted out
 * so that a caller WITHOUT a request can use it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The reply route (threads/[threadId]/reply/route.ts) was the only place a
 * reply could leave with all of its consequences intact: the provider call,
 * the outbound `messages` row, the thread's list state, the feedback verdict,
 * the drafts marked sent, the composer auto-save removed. It needs a session.
 * The reply agent's live send has none — and the plan (§10) says its send must
 * be "extracted to a shared function, with CC added", because a second copy
 * of this logic is how the bookkeeping drifts: an agent send that the inbox
 * list, the drafts view or the learning loop sees differently from a person's.
 *
 * This function IS the route's logic, moved. The route parses and
 * authenticates exactly as before and calls it with `actor: { kind: "user" }`;
 * the agent's transport (ai/send-transport.ts) calls it with
 * `actor: { kind: "agent" }`. Same provider calls, same rows, same order.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IT DOES, IN ORDER (all of it the route's, verbatim in effect)
 *
 *   · resolves the sender override (`senderChannelId`) into provider ids
 *   · Instantly threads: picks the reply target (source message or latest
 *     inbound), detects a forward, sends via /emails/reply or /emails/forward
 *   · EmailBison threads: resolves the team from the channel, the reply to
 *     hang off, the sender_email_id from the inbound envelope; defaults `to`
 *     to the lead; sends via /replies/{id}/reply, or /replies/new when the
 *     subject was changed, multipart when there are attachments
 *   · records the outbound `messages` row with the provider's id
 *   · advances the thread (needs_reply, seen, last_message_at, preview)
 *   · `recordSendFeedback` — BEFORE the drafts are marked sent, AFTER the
 *     message is stored (see ai/feedback.ts for why that order matters)
 *   · marks the thread's pending `reply_drafts` sent
 *   · deletes the composer auto-save, best-effort
 *
 * Failures come back as `{ ok: false, status, body }` carrying exactly the
 * HTTP status and JSON body the route returned before, so the route can hand
 * them to the client unchanged and a person sees what they always saw.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE BODY IS TYPED, NOT FLAGGED
 *
 * The route's request carries `body` plus `content_type`. Here the two are one
 * discriminated value: `{ kind: "html", html }` or `{ kind: "plain", text }`.
 * The reason is the single most likely defect in an automated send: an agent
 * draft is PLAIN TEXT with real newlines, and the composer converts it to
 * HTML (`plainTextToHtml`) before it sends. Forwarding that text as HTML
 * delivers an introduction as one run-on block with every paragraph break
 * gone. A bare string with a flag lets that happen silently; a tagged value
 * makes the caller say which it is, and the compiler refuses the mistake.
 *
 * `plain` keeps the route's exact `content_type: "text"` behaviour: EmailBison
 * receives a text body, Instantly receives the text converted to HTML — see
 * the note on the Instantly send below.
