// Client-customizable pipeline stages — the shared, pure model used by the portal
// board, the Manage Stages editor, and the move API. NO I/O here (DB reads happen in
// the page / route); this module only defines the shape and resolves DB rows into the
// StageDef list the UI renders.
//
// SAFETY: this is a DISPLAY OVERLAY on the frozen `pipeline_stage` enum. A StageDef is
// either `canonical` (backed by a real enum value — drives the funnel/webhooks) or
// `custom` (a display-only workflow bucket that never touches the enum). All of this is
// only consulted when the `manage_stages` feature flag is on (Demo portal only); with
// the flag off, callers use the existing hardcoded path unchanged.
