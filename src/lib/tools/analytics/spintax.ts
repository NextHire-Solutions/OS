 * Spintax rendering.
 *
 * Lifted verbatim from the tool's `lib/spintax.ts`. Every reader of an email
 * body on the campaign page — the recipient preview, the "N variations" hint,
 * the editor's per-step count — goes through these, so a body is interpreted
 * one way on both sides of the port.
 *
 * Format verified against live campaign bodies:
 *   {Quick question, | Just a quick question, | I have a quick question,}
 * Braces, pipe-separated, spaces around the pipe are common and must be
 * trimmed. Nesting has not been observed but is handled anyway — it costs one
 * recursive call and the alternative is silently emitting literal braces.
 *
 * Rolling is SEEDED and deterministic, so Preview stays stable while a user
 * reads it and only changes when they press Shuffle. An unseeded Math.random()
 * would re-roll on every React render, which looks like a bug.

 *     {Hi|Hello|Hey}                  EmailBison
 *
 * Left as-is, the existing parser matches the INNER braces and reads "RANDOM "
 * as the first option — so a preview would render the word RANDOM into the
 * email and the group counter would count a group whose first choice is a
 * keyword. Normalising at the door means every downstream reader — the
 * preview, the counter, the variation estimate, the un-spintaxed signal —
 * keeps working on one syntax rather than learning a second.
