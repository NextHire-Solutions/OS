 * Leads, for the Replies view's breakdowns (spec §5.5).

 * 6,675 distinct leads out of 69,794. Two facts from EmailBison's pagination
 * docs decide the shape of this job:
 *
 *   * Page size is a FIXED 15 and `per_page` is ignored everywhere. A full walk
 *     of the lead list is 4,653 requests, and a cursor walk cannot be
 *     parallelised, so it is ~25 minutes of serial calls to find 10% of what it
 *     downloads.
 *   * Page-based paging is capped at 1000 pages, i.e. 15,000 records, and stops
 *     SILENTLY. The first version of this job hit exactly that guard and
 *     reported success having matched 464 of 6,677 repliers.
 *
 * Fetching by id instead runs at the client's concurrency of 4 and asks for
 * precisely the rows we need. Because it skips leads already stored, the first
 * run is a backfill and every run after it is seconds.

 * saturate that ceiling and finish in about forty. Sharding is also the only

 * page, so a killed run loses one page rather than 1,239.
