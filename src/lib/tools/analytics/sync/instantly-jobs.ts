/*
 * Pulling Instantly into the dashboard.
 *
 * Same three rules as every EmailBison job: idempotent, watermark advances only
 * on success, and a missed tick is a non-event because re-running converges.
 *
 * The shapes differ enough to be worth naming:
 *
 *  - Instantly hands back EVERY campaign's metrics in ONE call, where
 *    EmailBison needs one call per campaign. So the campaign sync is cheap.
 *  - The daily series carries no campaign id, so per-campaign days need one
 *    call each — 317 calls, well inside the 6,000/min budget.
 *  - `/emails` allows only 20 requests a minute. A full reply walk is ~227
 *    pages, so eleven minutes. That single limit is why replies sync
 *    incrementally off a watermark and why the deep sweep is a separate job.
