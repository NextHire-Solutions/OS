/*
 * One template campaign → one real campaign per client.
 *
 * Set a campaign up once, pick five clients, get five campaigns: each with the
 * sequence copied, its inboxes attached, and its own name. It replaces building
 * the same thing five times by hand.
 *
 * WHY NOT ONE CAMPAIGN SHARED BY FIVE CLIENTS. Because the arithmetic breaks.
 * campaign_clients is keyed one client per campaign, and every client number in
 * the product — the KPI band, the Clients table, Attribution — is a rollup over
 * the campaigns belonging to that client. A campaign counted under five clients
 * would make the Clients table sum to five times the band, and splitting its
 * sends between them needs a rule nobody has. One campaign per client keeps
 * every existing number correct and costs only that there are five to manage.
 *
 * LEADS ARE NOT COPIED, DELIBERATELY. The whole point is that these campaigns
 * go to DIFFERENT audiences — that is what makes them different clients. Copying
 * the template's leads would mail one client's list under another's name, which
 * is the worst thing this feature could do. They land empty, ready for leads.
