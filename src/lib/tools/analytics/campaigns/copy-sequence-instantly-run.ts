 * Previewing costs two reads and writes nothing. Applying is a single PATCH:
 * Instantly holds the whole sequence in one field, so unlike EmailBison's
 * Replace — which deletes the old steps and then creates the new ones, and can
 * strand a campaign with neither — this cannot half-apply. Either the new
 * sequence is there or the old one is untouched.
