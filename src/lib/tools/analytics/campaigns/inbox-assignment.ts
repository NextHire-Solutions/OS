 * its inboxes: `email_list`, a frozen array of addresses, and `email_tag_list`,
 * the pool assignment. Measured on this workspace, every campaign with real
 * send volume uses the second and has the first empty — Howe Realty, Camelot,
 * C21 all carry the "Nicole Pool" tag and no explicit addresses.
 *
 * That matters because a tag stays LIVE. Assign "Nicole Pool" and the campaign
 * sends from whatever that pool holds today; add 20 inboxes to it next month
 * and they apply on their own. Expanding the pool into 428 addresses instead
 * pins a copy that is wrong the first time the pool changes, and nothing would
 * say so.
 *
 * So this writes one tag id rather than 428 addresses. The read-modify-write is
 * still required — a campaign can carry SEVERAL pools (Howe Realty campaigns
 * carry two) and writing only the tag being assigned would detach the others.
 * Verified on a throwaway campaign: `email_list` and `email_tag_list` are
 * independent, so this cannot disturb a campaign deliberately pinned to
 * specific addresses.
 *
 * Serial for the same reason as the EmailBison side: a whole-array replace has
 * no merge semantics, so two concurrent writes to one campaign lose one of them.
