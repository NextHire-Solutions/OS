/*
 * Duplicate a campaign and re-sequence the people who never answered.
 *
 * EmailBison's own duplicate copies the SEQUENCE and nothing else — verified:
 * duplicating a campaign with 2 leads and 536 inboxes produced a draft with the
 * 4 steps, 0 leads and 0 inboxes. That is the gap this closes.
 *
 * THE NEW CAMPAIGN IS LEFT AS A DRAFT, DELIBERATELY. Everything here is
 * reversible while it is a draft: a wrong lead set can be removed, wrong
 * inboxes detached, the whole campaign deleted. The moment it is resumed it
 * starts emailing thousands of real people. Starting it is a separate,
 * confirmed decision that already exists on the Campaigns page, and this does
 * not make it for you.
 *
 * COPY, NOT MOVE. The leads stay on the source campaign. Removing them would
 * delete that campaign's history for them — its sends, opens and replies all
 * read from the same membership — and they are already sequence-finished there,
 * so leaving them costs nothing and preserves the record.
