/*
 * Removing leads from an Instantly campaign.
 *
 * Same contract as the EmailBison path (lead-membership.ts): chunked, audited,
 * and honest about partial success. Two things differ, both from the platform:
 *
 *  - `DELETE /leads` takes `{campaign_id, ids}` and answers 200 without saying
 *    how many it acted on. So `applied` is measured the only honest way
 *    available — by counting what is GONE from our own table afterwards, not by
 *    trusting the request size. The EmailBison path does the same thing for the
 *    same reason.
 *  - A move-leads job LOCKS the campaign (409, see the findings doc). That is
 *    reported as the platform's own words rather than retried, because a
 *    removal racing an in-flight move is not something to force through.
