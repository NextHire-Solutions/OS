/*
 * Adding and removing a campaign's leads.
 *
 * Both directions change what real prospects receive, so both follow the rules
 * campaign actions already established: the caller is named in the audit log,
 * EmailBison is the authority, and nothing reports success it did not get.
 *
 * BATCHED, BECAUSE THE SELECTION CAN BE THOUSANDS. "Remove every lead that
 * never replied" on campaign 55 is ~6,000 ids. One request with 6,000 ids is a
 * request that times out halfway with no way to know what it did. Chunks are
 * small enough to succeed and are reported per chunk, so a partial failure
 * names exactly how far it got.
 *
 * SERIAL, NOT PARALLEL. These mutate one campaign's membership; firing chunks
 * concurrently at the same campaign invites the API to interleave them, and a
 * half-applied membership is not something you can diff afterwards.
 */

 * EmailBison documents no cap. 500 is chosen to be obviously safe rather than
