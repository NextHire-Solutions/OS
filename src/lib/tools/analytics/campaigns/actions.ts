/*
 * Applying campaign actions.
 *
 * Three rules, all from spec §9 ("every action is deliberate, confirmed, and
 * recorded") and §9.5 ("if a change can't be applied on the sending platform,
 * the dashboard says so with the actual reason, and does not show the change as
 * saved"):
 *
 *  1. EmailBison decides. The local row is updated only AFTER a 2xx, so the UI
 *     can never show a state the sending platform doesn't have.
 *  2. Every attempt is logged, including failures — a refused pause is exactly
 *     the event someone will come looking for.
 *  3. A bulk action is a fan-out that reports PER ITEM. Pause, resume and
 *     archive have no bulk endpoint, so "23 of 25 paused" is the honest answer
 *     and a single ok/failed for the batch is not.
