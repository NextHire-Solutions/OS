 * no-op, or to notice a campaign was sending from the wrong pool.
 *
 * READ FROM EMAILBISON, NOT THE CACHE. Nothing here stores campaign→inbox
 * membership: sender_emails knows every inbox and campaign_lead_sends knows
 * which ones have SENT, which is a different and older fact. A campaign
 * assigned a pool an hour ago has sent from none of it yet.

 * The tags come from our cache and are joined on afterwards, so the answer can
