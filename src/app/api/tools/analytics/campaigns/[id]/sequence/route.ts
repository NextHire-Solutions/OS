 * "Changes are saved only when you press Save. If you try to leave with unsaved
 * edits, you'll be warned. Nothing goes live by accident."
 *
 * The editor sends the WHOLE sequence as the user arranged it and this route
 * works out the three calls EmailBison actually needs, because it has no
 * save-my-sequence endpoint:
 *
 *   updates  -> PUT  /api/campaigns/v1.1/sequence-steps/{sequence_id}   (needs ids)
 *   adds     -> POST /api/campaigns/v1.1/{campaign_id}/sequence-steps   (appends)
 *   removals -> DELETE /api/campaigns/sequence-steps/{id}               (one each)
 *
 * Order matters. Updates run FIRST so a reorder lands even if a later add
 * fails, and deletes run LAST so a sequence is never briefly empty. Deleting a
 * step that has already sent is refused by EmailBison, so those are rejected
 * here with the reason rather than attempted.
