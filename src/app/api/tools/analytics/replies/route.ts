 *
 * The dimension list is READ FROM THE DATABASE, not hardcoded, because §5.5
 * requires it to be per-client configurable: "another client can be set up with
 * their own list without a rebuild". When exactly one client is selected, that
 * client's own list wins over the default.
 *
 * Every card is fetched in one parallel batch. They share a date range and a
 * positive-only toggle, so a card that lagged behind the others would show a
 * different population from the one beside it.
